Hello again!

We have finalized our project!

When we met with Professor Gore, we presented the idea on the Sentiment Analysis of Twitter live stream. He seemed to like the idea and agreed to let us continue on with it!

Professor Gore said he will provide us some material on Sentiment Analysis so we can start with the theory and grasp the basics and the concepts. 

We have also found a few IEEE papers on the topic, which will shed some light on how it has to be implemented.

I know this is a small post, but as we move on with the project, you can expect it to get bigger and bigger!

That's all for now.

Till the next post, *goodbye and have a nice day!* :D
