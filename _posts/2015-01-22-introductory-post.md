Hello!
This is the blog for a college project of five students from MNNIT Allahabad.
We have decided to call ourselves PanchDevs.
All our work related to the project can be found at [this github organization](https://github.com/panchdevs).
This blog will act as a journal from initiation to completion of the project.

To start off, we'll introduce ourselves.
We are students of Computer Science and Engineering in our third year, at MNNIT Allahabad.
Our names are:

* [Vivek Agarwal](https://github.com/vivek-17)
* [Abhijit Katiyar](https://github.com/abhijitkatiyar)
* [Prashant Baisla](https://github.com/pbaisla)
* [Aashish Thyagarajan](https://github.com/aashishthy)
* [Shakti Ranjan](https://github.com/India458)

We are doing this project under the mentorship of Professor M. M. Gore.


Ideas
-----
We met Professor Gore on 9 January, the day after he was assigned as our mentor.
We had a lengthy meeting in which he advised us on how to go about doing the project and suggested that we start writing a blog to post updates on our progress.
He gave us two weeks time to come up with ideas after which we would finalize the project.

After some thinking, the five of us had a team meeting.
Each of us presented their ideas to the rest of the group and after much discussion we pooled all our ideas together and come up with a dozen or so likely ideas.
They are listed below:

1. Cloud Architecture for the Internet of Things (IoT) to reduce data movements
2. Sentiment Analysis of Rotten Tomatoes (or other similar sites) comments and user analysis
3. Analysis of Driver Profiles to recommend insurance policies
4. Cloud Migrations
5. Data Wrangler
6. Using a single mouse and keyboard to control different devices across multiple platforms
7. Text Extraction from images
8. Image Descriptions using Image Processing
9. Blogging Engine
10. Human Computation
11. Augmented Reality
12. An app which converts highlighted portions of text into bullet points
13. Face Recognition for attendance (or other uses)


After more discussion and taking a vote we narrowed the above down to the following ideas: 

1. Text Extraction from an image
2. Blogging Engine
3. Sentiment Analysis
4. Cloud Architecture for IoT to reduce data movement
5. Human Computation
6. Analysis of Twitter live stream with Big Data, Data Mining and Machine Learning

That's all for now.
Tomorrow we will meet Professor Gore and present our ideas to him.
You can expect another blog post declaring the project soon.
Till then, *goodbye and have a nice day!*
